**Effect of Climate change in the world.**

Climate change is a term that refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate system, such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and ocean currents. Climate change is caused by both natural and human factors, but the main driver of the current warming trend is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. Climate change has significant impacts on the environment, society, and economy, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, and human health risks. To mitigate and adapt to climate change, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance carbon sinks, promote renewable energy sources, conserve natural resources, and support vulnerable communities.
